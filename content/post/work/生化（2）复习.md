## chapter 13 Bioenergetics and biochemical reaction types

Recall a basic formula that defines free energy G in chemistry:
$$
ΔG = ΔH-TΔS
$$
where $H$ stands for enthalpy and $S$ stands for entropy. As for biological reactions, they happen in a relatively fixed range of temperature, and $ΔS$ is determined by reactants and products,  so $ΔG$ value changes according to ΔH (which is often determined by the amount of ATP in the reaction). 

catabolism represents the reactions that release energy, and anabolism includes reactions that needs energy.

![image-20221227182035633](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/27/C9lNXKMwm6PTp4h.png)

I'm not quite sure whether *Schrödinge* is the first one to raise the idea that the stuff of life is related to enthalpy. Anyway, this idea do seems amazing, but we will leave the amazing things for the physicists and go on with boring things.

Our chemistry lesson didn't finish here. Remember that
$$
ΔG=ΔG^{'o}+RTlnQ\\
ΔG^{'o}=-RTlnK
$$
Mind that $ΔG^{'o}$ used in biology is measured under pH=7 environment. Since the reaction is affected by concentration of reactants and products, the $ΔG$ in real situation should be calculated as above. Approximately speaking, ΔG^{'o}=-30.5kJ/mol can tell us whether a reaction releases free energy or receives free energy, but this is not accurate because the concentration is far from $1mol/L$.

We take a look at the famous reaction:
$$
ATP+H_2O\rightarrow ADP+Pi,ΔG^{'o}=-30.5kJ/mol\\
1cal=4.184J
$$
This is an exergonic reaction (this fancy word means that this reaction releases energy).

Though ATP act as source or storage of energy in most reactions, certain muscle tissue takes a different way. They store energy through phosphocreatine.

![image-20221227191733605](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/27/BXmhd5bajyNKiDE.png)

Phosphocreatine act as a stable Pi carrier. Through this reaction, the cells control its ATP level in moderate concentration. A resting human consumes about 40 kg of ATP in 24 hours. Another interesting fact is that luciferase, an enzyme that produces fluorescent in fireflies consumes little ATP so they can measure ATP in a few picomoles (10^-12mol) 

Now we will talk about oxidation and reduction. Chemistry tell us that
$$
ΔE=E_o-E_r\\
E=E^o+\frac{RT}{nF}ln\frac{[acceptor]}{[donor]}
$$
and the connection between $ΔG$ and $ΔE$ is shown in this equation
$$
ΔG=-nFΔE
$$
Some of the energy released in reactions is directly stored in ATP, but other reaction (especially those that generate NADH, NADPH, and FADH_2) will create electrochemical potential and indirectly leads to ATP synthesis. Note that the vitamin form of NAD and NADP is niacin.

A whole picture of metabolism looks like this:

## chapter 14 **Glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the catabolism of glycogen**

Glycolysis is every biology student's first love (or first hate). In glycolysis, glucose is degraded to pyruvate. Before talking about this metabolic pathway, first we have a look at the metabolic fate fo glucose

![image-20221227205129353](C:/Users/bubble/AppData/Roaming/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20221227205129353.png)

An important method to figure out a pathway (in ancient time) is radioactive label. This is highly restricted these days because there are many people doing experiment today

![A summary pathway diagram of glycolysis, showing the multi-step conversion of glucose to pyruvate. Each step in the pathway is catalysed by a unique enzyme.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Glycolysis_metabolic_pathway_3.svg/400px-Glycolysis_metabolic_pathway_3.svg.png)

Important steps in glycolysis are the first step, the third step, the sixth step and the last step (in which ATP synthesis or consumption is involved).

The first step of glycolysis looks like this

![image-20221227210338247](C:/Users/bubble/AppData/Roaming/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20221227210338247.png)

ATP molecule needs Mg^2+ to neutralize the negative charge. So the reactant is actually MgATP^2- instead of ATP^4-. The cells phosphorylate these intermediates for good reasons. The charged molecule (due to phosphorylation) can't diffuse out of the cell and the phosphoryl group will also help enzymes to recognize its substrate.

The third step of glycolysis is here:

![image-20221229122656226](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/29/I9zRqkx51VcOBs4.png)

PFK-1 is a key enzyme in glycolysis regulation. We will talk about this later.

The sixth step is 

![image-20221229123051160](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/29/OfLvIl9zFmgGKu3.png)

Which is the only step in glycolysis that involves NADH synthesis. The next step of it is the so-called **substrate level phosphorylation** step contributes to ATP net gain in glycolysis, which makes it extremely important for anaerobic organisms. 

Finally the last step

![image-20221229123645221](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/29/ZRgDz8Oe5LIwB3l.png)

another substrate level phosphorylation.

A quick way to deal with the pyruvate is fermentation. In human beings, fermentation mainly happen in muscle. 

![image-20221229134747409](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/29/5gPOokH1jSQI7ex.png)

The lactate is then transported to liver and go through gluconeogensis. The whole procedure that turns glycogen to lactate then back to glycogen is called **the Cori Cycle**.

Another fermentation pathway is ethanol fermentation.

![image-20221229141219576](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/29/TgrR9zuG6bYHdED.png)

Now let's come back to glycolysis. Not only glucose goes through glycolysis, other hexocarbonhydrate also goes through this pathway.

![image-20221229141739819](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/29/zLRnwNQxVJ2vkmb.png)

So where does glucose come from? Starch will be digested by Salivary α-amylase and Pancreatic α-amylase. Lactose intolerance syndrome, a common syndrome in Asian people, is caused by lack of lactase which turns lactase into D-galactose and D-glucose. The degradation of starch and glycogen involves phosphorolysis:

![image-20221229192923512](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/29/Fgoynvu1WJj75aI.png)

Glucose 1-phosphate is then turned to Glucose 6-phosphate (by glucose 1-phosphate mutase) and joins Glycolysis.

Ribose is synthesized  through pentose pathway, the overall reaction of this pathway is 
$$
Glucose-6-phosphate + 2NADP^+ + H_2O \rightarrow 
ribose-5-phosphate +2NADPH+ CO2 + 2H^+
$$

This is not a important pathway so I don't want to pay much attention to it (especially in the exam week)

Now we take a look at the regulation of glycolysis. Recall some basic approaches of regulation through the following figure:

![image-20221230120333074](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/30/7I39BSmFW41sx52.png)

 Three regulatory enzymes in glycolysis are

1. Hexokinase
2. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1)
3. Pyruvate kinase

They all catalyze exergonic and irreversible reactions, and regulated by allosteric (别构) effectors. The most important one among them is PFK-1 

![image-20221230120516922](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/30/Hr6N9wCEu2LgZIW.png)

Citrate is a chemical synthesized in TCA circle and can be transported to cytosol, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate has a long story and we will talk about it later.

Glycogen breakdown is also regulated (Molecules are born free but everywhere is in chains). The glycogen phosphorylase has two isozymes, one in liver and one in muscle, but they are regulated similarly with different effectors:

![image-20221230122737919](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/30/UCAdNehTsYJwb6p.png)

## Chapter 16 the citric acid cycle

This is the hall of fame in metabolism because the intermediates in this cycle will appear many times in other metabolic pathways. CAC is also called tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) or Krebs cycle (named after the one who discovered it), occurs in eight steps in mitochondria.

The whole cycle can be divided into three stages. In stage I, all the fuel molecules (including pyruvate) are turned into acetyl-CoA. In the second stage, acetyl-CoA is completely oxidized. And in the last stage, oxidation phosphorylation happens.

We may intentionally bind TCA to glycolysis, but in fact TCA can be the downstream of many pathways.

![image-20221231130107274](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/31/8Rtwcj4IvyKd9zE.png)

Yet here we mainlly focus on how Acetyl-CoA is oxidized from pyruvate. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called PDH, with the help of TPP.

![image-20221231132234764](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/31/f6DB8bGqOCxY5VU.png)

The long lipoyllysine(硫辛酰赖氨酸) chain is responsible for the switch between different catalytic subunits.

So now we have acetyl-CoA, and we can start the cycle. The whole cycle looks like this.

![image-20221231133049835](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/31/fwmDdWaTv17knMu.png)

I don't have much to say about this cycle. Just note the steps that synthesize GTP(ATP), NADH and FADH_2.

The complete oxidation of glucose generates 30 or 32 ATP, depending on the way of NADPH transfer.

![image-20221231162544958](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/31/qptfN4eS7kO9B6K.png)

Remember that TCA is the hall of fame, the members in it has their own shining points.

![image-20221231162642712](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/31/bpw1OLkZiCGyNMu.png)

This raises a question: where does the intermediates come from? A main source is from pyruvate or phosphoenolpyruvate.

![image-20221231162842083](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/31/HjMlcpeLXsZfiw4.png)

Pyruvate needs biotin as a coenzyme.

According to the usual procedure, now we should start talking about the regulation of TCA. We just take a look at the irreversible steps. They follow the general rule of negative feedback: inhibited by products and stimulated by ingredients.

## Chapter 25 DNA metabolism

The deduced double helix structure indicated indicated that DNA has a semiconservative mechanism of replication. This is proved by a famous experiment conducted in *E. coli* cells. After labeling the DNA with $^{15}N$ which makes the chain heavier, they found that the newly synthesized DNA has H-H, H-L and L-L. Yet this is a rough understanding on DNA replication. Some details remains to be determined.

Deepgoing study is carried out with autoadiography. As for *E. coli* whose chromosomal DNA is a huge circle, daughter strands are synthesized immediately after parental strands separate. No temporary creation of linear DNA occurred during replication of the circular DNA. DNA replication begin at specific sites and proceed bidirectionally. After this, the researchers purified the DNA polymerase and studied DNA polymerization in vitro.

Basic information is that when DNA polymerase works in vitro, it needs DNA template, primer and dNTPs. The fundamental reaction for DNA synthesis is a nucleophilic attack by the 3'-OH group of the strand on the 5' α-phosphorus of a incoming dNTP selected via base-pairing. 

DNases can be divided into exonuclease and endonuclease. The former remove the nucleotide one by one, either from 5' to 3' or from 3' to 5', while the latter can cut the DNA at any site. DNA pol I can be divided into two fragments.

![Quicker_20221218_134123](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/19/ZvoWNmAeaptjED9.png)

In DNA pol I, 3'->5' exonuclease activity is able to remove mismatched base pairs, in order to proofread the nucleotides, and 5' -> 3' enables it to catalyze the nick translation process which removes RNA primers and can be used in DNA repair.

The synthesis of daughter DNA strands is semidiscontinuous. One of the strands  (called leading strand) is synthesized continuously and the other one (called the lagging strand) discontinuously. Okazaki fragments occurs on the lagging strand. These Okazaki fragments will be join together by DNA lingase to form a complete strand. 

Despite all these discussions about DNA pol I, this enzyme is found not to be responsible for DNA replication. Its velocity is too low and it can only add about 50 nucleotide before it dissociates from the template. The one that is responsible for DNA replication is actually DNA pol III which have no 5' ->3' exonuclease activity. 

DNA pol III has three main subunits. α subunit has polymerization activity, ε subunit has 3' -> 5' proofreading exonuclease activity, and β subunit has clamp activity that binds the whole enzyme tightly to the DNA.

Aside from DNA polymerase III, many other proteins are also part of the **replisome** for DNA replication in *E. coli*, such as

1. the helicase (dnaB) that consumes ATP to separate the two strands.
2. the topoisomerases that relieve the topological strains in the helical structure.
3. the single strand binding protein (SSB) that binds to the single-stranded DNA generated.
4. the primase (dnaG) that generates a short RNA primer.
5. the DNA polymerase I (polA) that removes the primer and replace it by a DNA sequence.
6. the DNA ligase for sealing nicks between the Okazaki fragments.

In *E. coli*, the replication starts from a 245bp fragment called *OriC*. *OriC* contains 11 GATC sequences, the A can be methylated, replication is conducted once a time. 

The whole process of *E. coli* chromosomal DNA replication has three stages: initiation, elongation and termination. Various enzymes are needed in initiation, and the synthesis of leading and lagging strand is believed to be conducted by a  DNA pol III dimer. During termination stage, the two replication forks (moving in opposite direction) meet at the Ter sequence, and DNA topoisomerase IV separated the newly generated chromosome with the old one.

# Chapter 26 RNA metabolism

There are different types of RNA, some important types are rRNA (ribosome RNA), tRNA (transfer RNA) and mRNA (messanger RNA). RNA can also act as enzymes, there is a hypothesis that RNA catalyzes most of the metabolic reactions before protein occurred. 

Three types of RNA polymerase catalyze the transcription of most RNA.

| Type | Localization | Transcript          | Effect towards α-amanitin       |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| I    | nucleolus    | 18S, 5.8S, 28S rRNA | insecsitive                     |
| II   | nucleopalsm  | mRNA, snRNA         | strongly sensitive              |
| III  | nucleopalsm  | tRNA, 5S rRNA       | inhibited by high concentration |

![image-20221219211016753](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/19/Z39zkA4pWcSsTgR.png)

The mRNA that just come through transcription will be  further processed before it goes into translation. The further process include 5' end capping, removing introns (this is discovered by an interesting EM experiment), linking exons and 3' end polyadenylating. tRNA will also be cleaved, spliced and modified.

![image-20221219222627944](https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/19/79lTUaRpiqDAsd6.png)

There are four types of introns that are spliced through different mechanisms. A single mRNA can be spliced differently to encode different protein.

A single pre-rRNA can generate different types of mature RNA in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
