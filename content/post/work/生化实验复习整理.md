## Preparation & Separation

Our research target may be natural or recombinant. If it is natural, the situation looks like this: I have some cell, and things I want (proteins, nuclear acid, etc.) are in the cell. I don't need to be a genius to see that  I need to break the cell. Common ways to break the cell includes:  

1. ultrasonic  
2. 

We take protein as an example. It is important to know the molecular weight, pI and some other basic information of the target protein.  Be cautious to make sure that the target protein doesn't precipitate. Oxidation may also affect the target protein, so some weak reducing agent in the solution may be a good choice. inclusion body in prokarit cells aslo needs to be handled properly. For membrane protein, detergents are often added.

some basic ways of separation include:  
1. salt precipitation
2. dailysis

## Centrifugation

## Chromatography

Chromatography is a method that separates certain  
1. capture  
2. intermediate purification  
3. polishing

## Spectroscopic Analysis

Spectroscopic analysis  uses X-ray, Ultraviolet, visible or infrared light. For example, OD260/OD280 is used to evaluate whether a DNA sample is pure enough. The following things mainly focus on the measurement of concentration.

Recall some basic formulas like  
$$
λ=\frac{c}{v}, E=hv
$$
Absorbance is usually written as A or OD(optical density), there is the formula  
$$
A=-lg(\frac{I}{I_0})
$$
$I$ stands for the intensity of incident light and $I_0$ stands for the  intensity of  transmitted light.  

According to the **Beer-Lambert Law**, the concentration of a solution (c) is  and absorption (A) have  
$$
A=εcd
$$
$ε$ is a constant called **molar absorption coefficient** and $d$ is the thickness of the liquid. We can tell that a constant like $ε$ can easily be calculated through standard sample.

This can also be used to evaluated the affinity of enzymes.

## Electrophoresis

## Immunochemical techniques

### Western blot

We look at an example here.

We have protein X and protein Y, with molecular weight already known, and we want to know weather they interact with each other. So we designed such an experiment.  

proteinA: GST-mCherry-X  
proteinB: His-Y-EGFP  
proteinC: GST-mCherry  

GST and His are used to purify these protein since they are expressed in bacteria. EGFP and mCherry have color (makes me think of the lyric "all I can see is black and white.") so we can see them.

Now we have the proteins, if the proteins interacts with each other, we need to give them a chance to interact.  So the pull-down method is used here. IP, Co-IP and pull down seems alike, the reasons they have different names are listed below  

IP(Immunoprecipitation): it looks quite like a chromatography, the fixed phase is changed into a beed  which makes the protein precipitate.   

Co-IP: the protein precipitated is a pair of proteins that interacts with each other.   

pull-down: pull-down is IP without I, it doesn't rely on antigen-antibody binding.

TBST: TBS(Tris-HCl) + tween-20: 吐温是一种非离子型表面活性剂,可以洗掉一些非特异性结合的蛋白和抗体,降低背景。
